            <h2>Taking the First Step</h2>
            <p>Are you ready for a night of music, people, and adventure? If this is your first time, you have come to the right place! Don't let the name mislead you, there are many latin dances you will encounter at a salsa club. The three most popular dances are: merengue, bachata, and salsa. Also, check your worries at the front door, it is completely normal to feel nervous when going social dancing but I promise you once you will settle in you will walk away with new memories, if not a few new friends by the end of the night.   </p>

            <h2>Looking the Part</h2>
            <p>First things first... hygiene. You are going to be upclose and personal with a lot of people, a little toothpaste and deodorant go a long way. Next up is what you are going to wear, I recommend wearing breathable clothing, and since you probably do not own dance shoes, flat shoes with little traction or 2.5" heels. Remember you are going to get sweaty, so wear fabric that does not turn translucent when it gets wet. As for how dressy you should go, that is up to you. I recommend treating this like a date if you are uncertain. Lastly, if you are going to wear a dress or skirt I would recommend wearing spanks underneath -- best to avoid a "I see London, I see France" situation. </p>

            <h2>Etiquette</h2>

            <p>Respect is key in any social environment, but goes doubly so when dancing. I'll get this out of the way now, just because someone <em>wants to dance with you</em> doesn't mean <em>they want to go home with you</em>. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the embarrassment of being <b>that</b> person. Now that is out of the way, your mission is simple: do not step on anyone's toes. Literally, you want to make sure you dance with a good buffer of space to avoid colliding with an adjacent couple. Metaphorically, you want to avoid over-dancing with the same person on repeat, better to mix it up and ask somebody new. Also, when somebody declines your request to dance there could be so many reasons unrelated to you, so don't take it personally! Just move on to the next person, and try again at a later time.</p>

            <h2>Attending the Group Lesson</h2>
            <p>Oftentimes the group is complimentary, or included in your nominal entry fee into the club. For a new dancer this is mandatory and will ease you into the enviroment, not to mention, they are a lot of fun. Your instructor will introduce the basic patterns of a couple dances for you, and usually have you rotate partners in the class. Also, it is comforting to know you are in a group with a bunch of people at the same experience level as yourself. After an hour or so passes you'll be warmed up just in time for the lights to fade and the DJ to start the music.</p>

            <h2>Merengue</h2>
            <p>Merengue is the simplest and most essential latin dance, and is called a stomping dance. As a new dancer, merengue will be your best friend and best teacher.</p>

            <h2>Bachata</h2>
            <p>Bachata is best known for its sensual movements. However, that is only one form of bachata called <em>bachata sensual</em>. Bachata itself does not need to be the quintessential image of dirty dancing, and can be danced at a standard two-hand-hold distance the entire dance.</p>

            <h2>Salsa</h2>
            <p>Salsa is a fast pace dance that moves back and forth on a line on the floor that we call the slot. Its name, which means sause in Spanish, refers to the fact it is made of many ingredients. Many of the salsa basics are, in fact, the basics from other dances that were thrown into the sause. </p>
